# Classify-Book-Genres
The task at hand involves predicting the genre of a book based on its features, such as author popularity, book length, and the number of keywords. This is a multi-class classification problem, where the goal is to categorize books into genres like Fiction, Non-Fiction, Mystery, etc. The process begins by loading the dataset, which contains both the features and the target variable (genre). The features include numerical values like author popularity, book length, and the number of keywords, while the target variable is categorical (genre). To make the target variable compatible with machine learning algorithms, the genre labels are encoded into numeric values using a LabelEncoder.

Next, the dataset is split into training and testing sets, with 80% used for training the model and 20% reserved for testing. The Random Forest Classifier, a robust ensemble learning method, is then used to train a model on the training data. This model builds multiple decision trees and aggregates their results to make predictions about book genres. After training, the model is evaluated on the test set by making predictions and comparing them to the true labels.

To assess the modelâ€™s performance, several metrics are calculated, including accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score. These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of how well the model is performing. The confusion matrix is also computed to visually inspect how the model's predictions compare to the actual genres. A heatmap of the confusion matrix is generated to make it easier to interpret the results.

Overall, the code provides a complete solution for classifying books into genres using a Random Forest Classifier. It includes essential steps like data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization, all aimed at understanding and improving the model's performance. The evaluation metrics and confusion matrix help pinpoint where the model is excelling and where it might need improvement, offering valuable insights into its effectiveness.
